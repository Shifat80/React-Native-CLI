## Notes

- **First Release**: Extra testing recommended
- **Major Versions**: Consider pre-release versions (1.0.0-beta.1)
- **Breaking Changes**: Update major version and document migration
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive data or tokens
- **Backup**: Keep local backup of working version before publishing

## Support

After release, be prepared to:
- Respond to GitHub issues quickly
- Provide documentation updates
- Release patches for critical bugs
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

**Remember**: Once published to npm, versions cannot be changed. Always test thoroughly!
